#### Brief Description of Project - 

 discover travel is a trusted and experienced travel company founded in 
2012. It has also introduced services based on foreigners visiting Sri Lanka. 
Foreigners visiting Sri Lanka can avail all the services from booking a flight such as 
booking a hotel to knowing about the beautiful places in Sri Lanka and to knowing
about the activities at those places. Like many services, the ability to get guides is 
available through the application.

Also, a travel package has been introduced for the convenience of tourists. 
Packages can be booked according to the number of visitors and the nature of the 
visitors. Also, travel insurance has been introduced for the protection of tourists. 
The traveler who wishes can register and the companies will determine if he or 
she can keep it for free based on the services we provide.

By providing these services, we hope to provide every visitor to Sri Lanka 
with the ability to access all services from a single location and a high level of 
service. Also, one of our responsibilities is to earn foreign exchange for the 
Government of Sri Lanka.
