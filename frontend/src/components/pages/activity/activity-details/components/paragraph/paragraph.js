          Man is a traveler by nature. He does not like to keep static at a
          place for a long time. So, people like to visit new places whenever
          they find time and opportunity. People travel for different purposes.
          Some travel for getting an education and some travel for pleasure.
          Many people also travel for business and employment. Travelling is,
          indeed, very pleasant. It is useful too. By traveling to new places we
          can know new people and learn many new things. Travelling opens new
          vistas of experience and understanding for us. When we go to a new
          place all of our senses and instincts become awake.In such
          circumstances, we can learn new things very easily.Everything seems
          beautiful and sterling in a new place. With new scientific inventions,
          the ways and means of traveling have changed dramatically. Now
          different types of vehicles are available to us. They include bus,
          truck, train, minibus, lorry, microbus, maxi, airplane, helicopter,
          spacecraft, submarine, launch, steamer, hovercraft etc. By these
          vehicles, we can cover a long distance within a short time. So, we
          should try to travel more and more.
